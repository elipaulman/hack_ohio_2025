# Friction Finder Challenge

## Background

We all experience friction in daily movement, whether it is waiting in line, finding a seat, navigating crowded spaces, or coordinating meetups. Small improvements can make big differences.

Our vision for mobility's future centers on serving people worldwide with the joy of expanding their life's potential and leading the advancement of mobility to enable people everywhere to improve their daily lives. This is not just about vehicles or transportation systems. It is about removing obstacles that prevent people from moving freely and efficiently through their world.

Your project will focus on the same fundamental goal: how to reduce friction in movement to give people more freedom and joy in their daily lives. The principles you explore about flow, prediction, and coordination can scale from campus paths to city streets to global transportation networks.

## Challenge

Identify a frustrating moment in how people or things move around campus or any familiar space, and design a solution that makes it smoother, faster, or less annoying.

Your project can involve technology, design, or software. The focus should be on creating a real, relatable, and practical improvement that helps people move with less friction.

### Examples:
- A crowd-aware route planner for campus
- A coordination tool for group meetups in busy areas
- A way to predict dining hall wait times
- A solution for bike rack availability
- A peer-to-peer campus courier system that connects people already walking nearby to deliver items or packages

## Things to Consider

**Identify a Real Problem**  
Focus on a genuine issue related to friction in movement. It could involve crowds, timing, communication, or resource availability. The key is to target a specific and relatable challenge.

**Think Big but Start Small**  
Your idea can be ambitious and creative, but your prototype can be simple. A minimal concept or demo can effectively show your solution's potential impact.

**Focus on the User**  
Consider who experiences this friction. Think about how your solution makes their day easier and smoother.

**Innovate**  
Explore new ways to improve flow and coordination. The best ideas often come from combining familiar concepts in new and unexpected ways.

**Impact Matters**  
Consider how your solution saves time, reduces stress, or improves comfort and accessibility. Even small wins in convenience can have a meaningful effect on people's experience.

## Judging

Solutions will be judged on:
- **Problem Solving**: Evaluation of how effectively your solution addresses the identified friction challenge
- **Creativity**: Assessment of the originality and innovation in your approach to solving the problem
- **Clarity**: Measurement of how clearly your team articulates the problem and proposed solution in the video pitch
- **Completeness**: Review of the thoroughness and detail in your proposed solution, including all necessary components

## Prizes

- **1st Prize**: $500 Amazon Gift Cards (Divided amongst team members)
- **2nd Prize**: $300 Amazon Gift Cards (Divided amongst team members)
- **3rd Prize**: $200 Amazon Gift Cards (Divided amongst team members)

## Kickstart Your Idea: A Simple Guide

Your project does not have to follow this exact format, but including these elements will help make your solution clear, effective, and impactful.

### 1. Identify a Specific Problem or Opportunity
- Start by defining the moment of friction you are addressing

### 2. Design a Solution
Think about how your solution improves one or more of the following:
- **Efficiency**: How can you save time, energy, or steps?
- **Accessibility**: How can you make movement easier for everyone?
- **Comfort**: How can you make experiences less stressful or confusing?
- **Predictability**: How can you help people plan or anticipate conditions?

### 3. Develop a Simple Prototype or Concept
- Create a demo, mockup, or interactive model that shows how your idea works

### 4. Create a Video Pitch (DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST FEW MINUTES TO UPLOAD)
- **Length**: 3ish minutes
- **Content**:
  - Introduce your team and project
  - Explain the problem or friction point
  - Describe your solution and how it works
  - Share why it matters and how it improves daily life
  - Highlight what you learned during development
